# Interview Assessment Tests

This repository contains a series of practical tests designed to evaluate different engineering skills:

## Directory Structure

- **P1_system_design**: Design a system that handles transactions.
- **P2_debugging_trouble_shooting**: Debugging exercise with a buggy calculator.
- **P3_code_review**: Code review exercise with a task tracker application.
- **P4_integration**: Integration exercise with a RESTful API service.
- **P5_pair_programming**: You'll have short exercise to complete in real time with a franc engineer.

## Test Descriptions


### P1_system_design
A system design challenge. Feel free to use any tools for your presentation.

### P2_debugging_trouble_shooting
A Python project using UV (Python package installer) with a calculator module that has a subtle bug. The candidate must:
- Set up the project using UV
- Run the failing tests
- Use a debugger to identify the issue in the `divide` function
- Fix the bug to make all tests pass

The exercise tests debugging skills, ability to use developer tools, and understanding of Python fundamentals.

### P3_code_review
A task tracker console application that doesn't fully meet its requirements specification. The candidate must:
- Review the code against the provided requirements
- Identify bugs and missing functionality
- Implement fixes for the identified issues
- Complete missing requirements

The exercise evaluates code review skills, attention to detail, and ability to implement features according to specifications.

### P4_integration
A bookstore management system with two components:
- A RESTful API service built with Flask (provided)
- A partially implemented client application (needs completion)

The candidate must:
- Complete the client application's missing functionality
- Implement proper API integration with error handling
- Create a user-friendly interface
- Test the implementation against the provided API

This exercise tests API integration skills, error handling, and user experience design.

## Getting Started

Each subdirectory contains its own README with detailed instructions for the specific test.

To begin any test:
1. Navigate to the specific test directory
2. Read the README.md file for detailed instructions
3. Set up the environment as instructed
4. Complete the tasks outlined in the requirements
